-   replace the input fields by instruction when not selecting exactly one feature
-	Beware of the writer writing NULL when saving empty <select> inputs. the array will no longer have length 0

-   Add code that will ensure that the touched flag gets set only when there is an actual change (moving the feat or changing one of its data)
